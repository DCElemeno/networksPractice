Networks Notes:      COMMUNICATING
Lecture 1 part 1
----------------

IP gives us the best effore datagram forwarding
	- very simple
	- large part of why internet succeeded
	- but doesnt givemuch

Layers give us a way to COMPOSE functionality
	- Eg. HTTP over TCP for web browsers with reliable connections

However, they do not tell us where in the network to implement the functionaility

=======================================================
Where do we distribute functionality accross devices?
	- Eg.who is responsibility

The End-to-end arguments in System Design"
	- Sacred text of the internet
	- Endlessly debated by researchers and engineers

=======================================================
Basic Observation

Some applications have end to end requirements
	(security, reliabilitty, etc.)

Implementing this stuff inside the network is hard
	- every step of the way must be fail proof
	- different applications have different needs

End hosts 
	- cant depend on the network
	- cant satisfy these requirements without network level support

Instead of making the network reliable, 
Solution is APp level, end to end check, and retry on failure

=======================================================
Conservative Interpertation:

	Dont implement a function at the lower levels of the system unless it can be completely implemented at this level

	basically, unless you can completely remove the burden from end hosts, don't bother

=======================================================
Radical Interpertation:
	
	Dont implement anything in the network that can be implemented correctly by the hosts

	This makes the network layer very minimal

	Ignores performance issues

=======================================================
Moderate Interpertation:

	Think twice before implementing functionality in the network

	If hosts can implement functionality correctly, implement it on a lower layer only as a performance enhancer

	But do so only if it does not impose burden on applications that do not require that functionality, and if it doesnt cost $$$

=======================================================
Anonymity:

	Should this be implemented in the network?

	Howabout at the endpoints?

=======================================================
Reality check: Layering and end-to-end protocols ideas are regularly violated

	There is a conflicting interest between Archetectural Purity and Commercial Needs 

=======================================================
Takeaways:

	Layering for network functions:
		- helps manage diversity in computer networks
		- not optimal for everything, but simple and flexible

	"Narrow waist" ensures interoperability, enables innovation

	End-to-Emd argument (attempts) to keep the IP layer simple

	Think carefully when adding functionality to the network
