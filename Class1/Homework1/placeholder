Goals of assignment:


make a client program that communicates to server using sockets

listens for requests on tcp socket bound to port 27993


PROTOCOL
4 messages: HELLO, STATUS, SOLUTION, BYE

1. client initiates the protocol by creating tcp socket connection to server
2. once connected, client sends HELLO message to server
	hello is: ____ HELLO 1
3. the server then replies with a STATUS
	status is: ___ STATUS [a number] [a math operator] [a number]\n
4. client returns with SOLUTION
	solution is: ___ [the solution]
	solution can be negative, for division floor
5. server will then either respond with another STATUS or BYE

	if BYE:
		means solution was correct
	if STATUS
		program must solve the expression and retur another SOLUTION

6. eventually the server will return a BYE message	
	the BYE message will contain the 64 byte flag
